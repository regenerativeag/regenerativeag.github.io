# More About our Community

## Community of Practice

We are regenerative practitioners (farmers and gardeners) who support each other.

Many of us work mostly alone in our gardens and fields. Many of us looking for more opportunities to connect with other practitioners about our work in regenerative ag. Our community enables us to be peers across the world who exchange experiences, struggles, encouragement, resources, ideas... and grow together ðŸ’ž

We welcome practitioners from other fields (e.g. teachers, students, artists and creators, landscapers, writers, entreprenuers, speakers, ...) who regenerate land or support regeneration through their work.

## A 'bottom-up' community

We are peers. We recognize that it's possible we could be wrong; all of us are fallible. We seek growth through listening to others' expereinces and perspectives, even when they contradict our own. We welcome many regenerative practices including conservation tillage, KNF, no-dig, agroforestry, and more.

We are also democratic. Our admins gather input from the community before moving forward on major decisions. As the community grows and is interested, we will host elections for admins and whichever other staff roles we the community deem fit.
