## Community of Practice

We are regenerative practitioners (farmers and gardeners) who support each other. Many of us work mostly alone in our gardens and fields.

We enjoy opportunities to connect with fellow practitioners about our work in regenerative ag. Our online community enables us to grow together with our peers across the world. We exchange experiences, struggles, encouragement, resources, ideas ...

We welcome practitioners from other fields (e.g. teachers, students, artists and creators, landscapers, writers, entrepreneurs, speakers, ...) who regenerate land or support regeneration through their work.

## Bottom-up

We are peers; we are democratic. Our admins gather input from the community before moving forward on major decisions. As the community grows and is interested, we will host elections for admins and whichever other staff roles we the community deem fit.

Our group respects differing perspectives. We recognize that it's possible we could be wrong&mdash;all of us are fallible. We seek growth through listening to others' experiences and perspectives, even when they contradict our own. We honor all regenerative practices including conservation tillage, regenerative grazing, Korean Natural Farming, No-Dig, agroforestry, and much more.

Our group most closely resembles a cooperative, and we intend to form a legally recognized _co-op_ when it makes sense to do so.
