title: Membership roles

Membership roles help us foster a more comfortable and enjoyable space to connect in. They give us progressively more possibilities for connection as we participate. For example, when you make your first post, you will be granted access to a private a room which is only visible to people who have recently posted.

### Visitor

_Visitors_ are those who just joined our community. Visitors are also those who were recently Inactive.

Visitors can...

- Post (and react) in most rooms

Visitors who haven't posted or reacted in 7 days are transitioned to the Inactive role.

### Guest

Once you create your first post, you will become our _Guest_.

In addition to what Visitors can do, Guests can...

- Post in `#connect`, a room just for Guests and Members
- Share pictures and links
- Create threads and polls
- Use custom stickers and emojis

Guests who haven't posted or reacted in 14 days are transitioned to the Inactive role.

### Member

If you post on at least 4 _different_ days\* in the last 60 days, you will become a _Member_ of our community.

In addition to what Guests can do, Members can...

- Post in `#community`, `#community-improvement`, `#projects`, and `#test-results-amendments-and-inoculants`
- Talk with other members in `#voice-room`
- Share recorded voice messages
- Choose a name-tag color

Members who haven't posted or reacted in the last 60 days are transitioned to the Inactive Member role.

_\* Days are measured in the GMT/UTC timezone. If you've posted on 4 different days and haven't gained the role, please try posting on another day._

### Active Member

The _Active Member_ role is granted to those who have posted on at least 8 different days, and 4 different weeks, in the last 60 days.

In addition to what Members can do, Active Members can...

- Post in `#off-topic`
- Create private threads
- Add custom emojis and stickers to our server

Active Members who haven't posted or reacted in the last 30 days are transitioned back to the Member role. Grace period: You can become an Active Member again by making a post within 7 days of losing the Active Member role.

### Inactive

Visitors who haven't posted or reacted in 7 days, and Guests who haven't posted or reacted in 14 days, are transitioned to the _Inactive_ role.

Those who are inactive...

- Can only see `#welcome`, `#announcements`, and a special empty room called `#quiet-garden`
- Can become a Visitor again by reacting with a üëç to the post in `#quiet-garden`

### Inactive Member

Members who haven't posted for 60 days are transitioned to the _Inactive Member_ role.

Inactive Members have the same abilities as those who are Inactive with two exceptions...

- Inactive Members keep their name-tag color
- Inactive Members become Members again (instead of Visitors) when they react with a üëç in `#quiet-garden`

Inactive Members who haven't posted or reacted for 365 days are transitioned to the Inactive role and lose their name-tag color.
