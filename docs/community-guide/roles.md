title: Membership roles

Membership roles help us foster a more comfortable and enjoyable space to connect in. They give us progressively more possibilities for connection as we participate. For example, when you make your first post, you will be granted access to a private a room which is only visible to people who have recently posted.

### Visitor

_Visitors_ are those who just joined our community.

Visitors can...

- Post (and react) in most rooms

Visitors who haven't posted or reacted in 7 days are transitioned to the Inactive role.

### Guest

Once you create your first post, you will become our _Guest_.

In addition to what Visitors can do, Guests can...

- Post in `#💬-connect`, a room just for Guests and Active Members
- Share pictures and links
- Create threads and polls
- Use custom stickers and emojis

Guests who haven't posted or reacted in 14 days are transitioned to the Inactive role.

### Active Member

If you post on at least 4 _different_ days\* in the last 60 days, you will become an _Active Member_.

Active Members have **full access** to our community.

In addition to what Guests can do, _Active Members_ can...

- Post in `#💞-community`, `#🤝community-development`, `#📔-projects`, `#🦠-amendments-and-inoculants`, and `#🔬-test-results`
- Talk with other active members in `#voice-room`
- Choose a name-tag color
- Share recorded voice messages
- Create private threads
- Add custom emojis and stickers to our server

Active Members who haven't posted or reacted in the last 14 days are transitioned to the Inactive Member role.

_\* Days are measured in the GMT/UTC timezone. If you've posted on 4 different days and haven't gained the role, please try posting on another day._

### Inactive

Visitors who haven't posted or reacted in 7 days, and Guests who haven't posted or reacted in 14 days, are transitioned to the _Inactive_ role.

Those who are inactive...

- Can only see `#welcome`, `#rules`, `#announcements`, and a special empty room called `#🌷-quiet-garden`
- Can become a Visitor again by reacting with a 👍 to the post in `#🌷-quiet-garden`
- Can become a Guest again by reacting with a 👍 to the post in `#🌷-quiet-garden` _**IF** they have posted at least once in the last six months_.

### Inactive Member

Active Members who haven't posted for 14 days are transitioned to the _Inactive Member_ role.

Inactive Members have the same abilities as those who are Inactive with two exceptions...

- Inactive Members keep their name-tag color
- Inactive Members become Active Members again (instead of Visitors) when they react with a 👍 in `#🌷-quiet-garden`

Inactive Members who haven't posted or reacted for 365 days are transitioned to the Inactive role and lose their name-tag color.
