title: Membership roles
---

Membership roles give us progressively more possibilities for connection as we participate. For example, when you make your first post, you will be granted the _Guest_ role which will give you access to a private room that is only visible to people who have recently posted.

## Visitor

_Visitors_ are those who have just joined, and have no membership roles yet.

Visitors can only post in the `#introductions` room.

## Guest

The _Guest_ role is granted to those have posted in the last 14 days. Guests...

- Can post in most rooms
- Are granted access to `#connect`, a room for guests and members to connect more privately

## Active Member

The _Active Member_ role is granted to those who have posted on at least 4 different days in the last 60 days. Active members...

- Are granted access to more rooms that are just for active members.
- Can choose their name-tag color

## Member

Active Members who don't post for at least 30 days are transitioned to the _Member_ role.

Members are unable to see or participate in the private rooms for Active Members. Members have nearly the same permissions as Guests. However, Members...

- Get to keep their name-tag color
- Only need to post on 2 different days in a 30-day period to regain the Active Member role

## Inactive

Visitors who haven't posted for 7 days, and Guests who haven't posted for 14 days, are transitioned to the _Inactive_ role.

Those who are inactive...

- Can only see `#welcome`, `#announcements`, and a special empty room called `#quiet-garden`
- Can become a visitor again by making a post in `#quiet-garden`
- Posts in `#quiet-garden` are immediately deleted

## Inactive Member

Members who haven't posted for 60 days are transitioned to the _Inactive Member_ role. Inactive Members have the same abilities as those who are inactive with two exceptions...

- Inactive Members keep their name-tag color
- Inactive Members become Members again (instead of Visitors) when they post in `#quiet-garden`

Inactive members who haven't posted for 180 days lose their name-tag color and are transitioned to the Inactive role.
