title: Membership roles

Membership roles give us progressively more possibilities for connection as we participate. For example, when you make your first post, you will be granted the **Guest** role which will give you access to a private room that is only visible to people who have recently posted.

## Visitor

Visitors are those who have just joined, and have no membership roles yet.

Visitors can only post in the #introductions room.

## Guest

The Guest role is granted to those have posted in the last 14 days. Guests...

- Can post in most rooms
- Are granted access to #connect, a room for guests and members to connect more privately

## Active Member

The Active Member role is granted to those who have posted on at least 4 different days in the last 60 days. Active Members...

- Are granted access to more rooms that are just for active members.
- Can choose their nametag color

## Member

Active members who don't post for at least 30 days are transitioned to the **Member** role.

Members are unable to see or participate in the private rooms for _active_ members. Members have nearly the same permissions as Guests. However members...

- get to keep their nametag color
- only need to post on two different days in a 30 day period to regain their "Active Member" role

## Inactive

Visitors who haven't posted for 7 days, and Guests who haven't posted for 14 days, are transitioned to the **Inactive** role.

Those who are inactive...

- Can only see #welcome, #announcements, and a special empty room called #quiet-garden
- Can become a visitor again by making a post in #quiet-garden
- Posts in #quiet-garden are immediately deleted

## Inactive Member

Members who haven't posted for 60 days are transitioned to the **Inactive Member** role. Inactive members have the same abilities as those who are inactive with two exceptions...

- Inactive members keep their nametag color
- Inactive members become Members again (instead of Visitors) when they post in #quiet-garden

Inactive members who haven't posted for 180 days lose their nametag color and are transitioned to the Inactive role.
