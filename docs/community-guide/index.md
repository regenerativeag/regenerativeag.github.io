# Community Guide

Here's an overview of our online environment, as well as our suggestions for how to connect with people in our group.

## Ways to participate

### Leave a "reaction" on someone's post

Online communication is different. We lose out on body language, tone, and a lot of what makes connection meaningful. However textual connection _can_ be quite meaningful. Emojis can add a layer of connection on top of text. You can add a thumbs up üëç, face üòÉ, heart üíû, or any other reactions on others' posts to respond without posting, and let them know you liked what they shared.

### Leave a comment or response to someone's share

Most of us share in hopes of connecting. Even just a small comment (e.g. "Lovely flowers!") can be a meaningful point of connection with a peer.

### Share something

Maybe it's a resource you liked, a question you're pondering, something going on in your garden or fields.... We'd love to see a glimpse into your journey. If you're not sure where to share, we recommend #connect (for guests) and #community (for active members).

## Ways to get more out of our community

### Take care of yourself

You having a comfortable experience is the best way we think we'll get to hang out with you more, so please take care of yourself and only participate when and how you feel most comfortable. Please don't push yourself to the point that hanging becomes uncomfortable or a chore!

### Check out our values

Knowing about our community will help us have more to discuss together. We are a [democratic community of practice](../more.md). We regenerate soil and/or support those who regenerate. We are all [enthusastic about regenerative agriculture](../regenerative-agriculture.md).

### Offer your input

Your input or idea could very likely help our community be better for you and others. If something is uncomfortable, enjoyable, or you have an idea, please find a [comfortable way to share it](../more.md#how-to-contribute)! Even if we already have a hunch, getting your validation could help us.

### Get involved with projects (active members only)

Share about a project you're working on, and offer some support in someone else's project!

### Attend an event (coming soon)

We're currently working on our first community event. Come check back soon to learn more!

### ...

We're working on ideas for facilitating more rewarding connection. We'd [love to hear your input and ideas](../more.md#more-about-our-community)!
