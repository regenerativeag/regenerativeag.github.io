Here's some ways you can help our community be more beneficial for everyone ðŸ’ž

#### Share and connect
- Share what's happening with your farm and projects, so we can learn from your journey.
- Provide encouragement, validation, feedback, and ideas to fellow community members.

#### Share our group with fellow regenerative farmers you think may be interested
- You can share a personal discord invitation from the `#welcome` channel
- Or you can share our website: [regenerativeag.github.io](https://regenerativeag.github.io){ target="_blank" }

#### Share your input, feedback, and ideas so we can improve!
- You can provide input when we occasionally propose important changes. Even just an emoji reaction can be quite validating and helpful ðŸ™‚
- We welcome you to post in `#connect`, `#community`, or `#community-improvement` with your feedback, suggestions, and/or ideas
- You can message Leo or Josh directly in discord
- And there's even a way for you to [share your thoughts anonymously](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScqbv80BA8k9KOz7m1VrOR5Qh0j2RoG7hE0wSmsCIWrDWTgmQ/viewform){ target="_blank" }!
