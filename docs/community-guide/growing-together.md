title: How to grow with us
---

Here's some ways we recommend participating that will hopefully enable us to grow more together 🙂

## Share something

Maybe it's a resource you liked, a question you're pondering, something going on in your garden or fields.... We'd love to see a glimpse into your journey.

If you're not sure where to share, we recommend `#connect` (for guests) and `#community` (for members).

You're welcome to share with us via text, pictures, videos, and/or links!

## Leave a "reaction" to someone's message

Emojis can add a layer of connection on top of text. You can add a thumbs up 👍, face 😃, heart 💞, or any other reactions on others' posts to respond without posting, and let them know you liked what they shared.

## Leave a comment or response

Most of us share in hopes of connecting. Even just a small comment (e.g. "lovely flowers!") can be a meaningful point of connection with a peer.

## Take care of yourself

You having a comfortable experience is the best way we think we'll get to hang out with you more, so please take care of yourself and only participate when and how you feel most comfortable. Please don't push yourself to the point that hanging becomes uncomfortable or a chore!

## Check out our values

Knowing about our community will help us have more to discuss together. We are a [democratic community of practice](../more.md). We regenerate soil and/or support those who regenerate.

## Offer your input

We're working on ideas for facilitating more rewarding connection. Your input or idea could very likely help our community be better for you and others. If something is uncomfortable, enjoyable, or you have an idea, please find a comfortable way to [share about it with us](./contribute.md#contact)!

Hearing your perspective will help, even if we've heard a similar perspective before. Democracy works best as more voices are heard and integrated.

## Get involved with projects

(Active members only). Share about a project you're working on, and offer some support in someone else's project!
