# Regenerative Agriculture

Regenerative agriculture is movement towards growing food and raising livestock in a way that enriches (instead of depletes) the ecosystems we farm in. Regenerative ag is a response to multiple impending global crises including depleted soils, destroyed land- and ocean-ecosystems, and climate change.

(more about our values, what's on our minds and hearts that drives us to regenerate, what brings us together)
