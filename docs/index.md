Regenerative agriculture is movement towards growing food and raising livestock in a way that enriches (instead of depletes) the ecosystems we farm in. Regenerative ag is a response to multiple impending global crises including depleted soils, destroyed land- and ocean-ecosystems, and climate change.

Since November 2023, several regenerative agriculture enthusiasts have come together and begun growing the roots of a new online community. We share together and support each other. Through our conversations, we have created a cozy and relaxed environment for discussing regenerative ag.
