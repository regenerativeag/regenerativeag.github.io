Since November 2023, several regenerative farmers have come together and begun growing the roots of a new online community. We share our regenerative journeys together. We support each other as we farm.

## We are regenerative practitioners

We are regenerative farmers and gardeners. We are also students, teachers, landscapers, researchers, artists, media creators, programmers, ... who regenerate or support regeneration through our work. We all share a passion in regenerative agriculture.

We come together to learn with our peers&mdash;to grow with fellow practitioners around the world. We believe in harmony. We share together and support each other because we believe we can find more prosperity and wellbeing by working together. [Learn more about our community](more.md).

Find fellowship on your regenerative journey 💞
